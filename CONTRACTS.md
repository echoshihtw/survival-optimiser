# AWARENESS — Development Contracts

> These contracts define the rules, decisions, and constraints that govern development. Every contributor (human or AI) must read and follow these before making changes.

---

## 1. Product Contract

### 1.1 Purpose
Awareness is a **personal financial survival tool**, not a budgeting app, not a portfolio tracker. Every feature must answer: *does this help the user know how long they can survive?*

### 1.2 The One Number
Runway is the hero metric. It is always the largest, most prominent number on screen. Nothing competes with it.

### 1.3 First Principles Rule
Before adding a feature, ask:
1. Does this serve the survival question?
2. Can the user understand it without a tutorial?
3. Does it add data or add noise?

If the answer to (1) is no, don't build it. If (2) is no, redesign it. If (3) is noise, cut it.

### 1.4 Simplicity Contract
> "If it needs a manual, it's not intuitive enough."

UX decisions must favor clarity over completeness. One rough number the user understands beats a precise number they have to think about.

---

## 2. Architecture Contracts

### 2.1 Layer Boundaries
```
presentation → application → domain ← data
```
- `domain` has zero Flutter dependencies
- `data` only knows about `domain` interfaces
- `presentation` never imports `data` directly
- `application` providers are the only bridge

Violations will break compile-time enforcement.

### 2.2 No Business Logic in Presentation
All financial calculations live in `domain/lib/logic/`. Presentation only formats and displays. If you find yourself doing math in a widget, move it to the domain.

### 2.3 Repository Pattern
All data access goes through repository interfaces defined in `domain`. No direct database calls from application or presentation layers.

### 2.4 Codegen
Run `make gen` after any change to:
- Drift table definitions
- Riverpod providers with `@riverpod` annotation

Never commit stale `.g.dart` files.

---

## 3. Domain Contracts

### 3.1 Burn Rate Formula
```dart
effectiveBurn = max(actualSpending, budgetEstimate) + subscriptions + debt
```
- `actualSpending` = average `grossOutflow` from transaction history
- `grossOutflow` excludes: income, loan inflows, investments
- `budgetEstimate` = rent + living (user-defined floor)
- Budget is a floor, never a ceiling — reality always wins when over

### 3.2 Runway Calculation
- No arbitrary cap — calculate mathematically beyond projection window
- `runwayMonths = projectedMonths + (lastBalance / burnRate).floor()`
- `runOutDate` = null only when burn rate is zero

### 3.3 Investable Calculation
```dart
safetyMonths = clamp(runwayMonths / 2, 6, 18)  // adaptive buffer
safetyCash   = effectiveBurn * safetyMonths
surplus      = currentCash - safetyCash
riskCapacity = clamp((runwayMonths - safetyMonths) / safetyMonths, 0, 1)
investable   = max(0, surplus × riskCapacity × pressureFactor)
```
Two pockets: SAFETY FUND (locked) and INVESTABLE (deployable). Never mix them.

### 3.4 Investment Transactions
Investment transactions reduce cash balance but are excluded from burn rate calculation. They are not expenses.

### 3.5 Subscription Normalization
All billing cycles normalize to monthly equivalent:
- Weekly: `amount × 52 / 12`
- Monthly: `amount`
- Quarterly: `amount / 3`
- Yearly: `amount / 12`

### 3.6 Loan Months Remaining
Uses `originalTermMonths - elapsed` — not `remainingBalance / monthlyPayment`. This ensures interest-bearing loans show accurate remaining term.

## 4. UI/UX Contracts

### 4.1 Color System
**Never use raw `AppColors.*` in presentation layer. Always use `SC.*` (semantic colors).**

| Semantic | Color | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `SC.life` / Mint | `#8FDDAA` | Cash, runway, stable status, survival charge |
| `SC.cost` / Pink | `#E8829E` | Total outflow, burn, critical status |
| `SC.subscr` / Purple | `#BB6DFF` | Subscriptions ONLY |
| `SC.chrome` / Gold | `#CB9A3E` | Debt, loan obligations |
| Turkish Blue | `#5B9DC4` | UI structure, investable, neutral |
| Smoke | `#CDD5E0` | All other numbers — neutral facts |

**Rule:** Color = semantic meaning, not decoration. Color a number only when it represents a distinct mental category.

### 4.2 Typography Hierarchy
- **Numbers/values** → JetBrains Mono (gaming soul)
- **Labels/titles** → Inter (clean, modern)
- **Hero number** (runway) → 72px, bold
- **Metric numbers** → 20px
- **Labels** → 11px, ALL CAPS, 1.0 letter spacing

### 4.3 Layout Rules
- Runway is always the hero — largest, most prominent, center-top
- Cards are expandable — key metrics always visible, details collapsed
- Section accent bar color = section identity (thin left bar)
- No more than 3 accent colors visible at once on screen

### 4.4 Component Rules
- Use `NeoButton` not `TerminalButton` for new UI
- Use `NeoInput` not `TerminalInput` for new UI
- Use `NeoCard` / `NeoExpandableCard` for all card containers
- Use `SC.*` for all colors in presentation layer
- Pill-shaped buttons (borderRadius: 50) for actions
- Round-corner cards (borderRadius: 16) for containers

### 4.5 Navigation
Three tabs only:
- **HUD** — main dashboard, survival overview
- **LOG** — transaction history and entry
- **SIM** — scenario simulator

No new top-level tabs without strong justification.

## 5. Data Contracts

### 5.1 Schema Versioning
Current schema version: **4**

| Version | Change |
|---|---|
| 1 | Initial: transactions table |
| 2 | Added: loanId to transactions, loans table |
| 3 | Added: subscriptions table |
| 4 | Added: originalTermMonths to loans |

Every schema change requires a migration in `MigrationStrategy`.

### 5.2 Opening Balance
Opening balance transactions are handled specially:
- Excluded from monthly aggregation loop
- Summed as starting cash before regular transactions
- If only opening balance exists → return synthetic MonthlyState

### 5.3 Transaction Types
```dart
enum TransactionType {
  expense,        // reduces cash, counts in burn rate
  income,         // increases cash
  loan,           // increases cash (loan proceeds)
  investment,     // reduces cash, EXCLUDED from burn rate
  repayment,      // reduces cash, counts in burn rate
  openingBalance, // sets starting cash
}
```

## 6. Localization Contracts

### 6.1 Supported Languages
EN, 繁中 (zh_TW), FR, JA, ES, IT

### 6.2 ARB Files Location
`packages/design_system/lib/l10n/`

### 6.3 Adding New Strings
1. Add to all 7 ARB files
2. Run `make gen-l10n`
3. Never hardcode user-facing strings in Dart files

### 6.4 No `//` Prefixes in Strings
ARB values must not contain `//` prefixes. They are for display only.

---

## 7. Testing Contracts

### 7.1 Domain Tests Required
All domain logic changes require corresponding tests in `packages/domain/test/`.

### 7.2 Test Coverage Areas
- `MonthlyAggregator` — always test edge cases (empty, opening only, mixed)
- `SurvivalEngine` — always test status thresholds and runway math
- `LoanEngine` — always test months remaining calculation
- New domain logic → new test file

### 7.3 Test Command
```bash
cd packages/domain && dart test
```
All 39+ tests must pass before any commit.

---

## 8. Git Contracts

### 8.1 Commit Message Format
```
feat: description of new feature
fix: description of bug fix
refactor: code change without behavior change
style: visual/UI changes
test: adding or updating tests
chore: build, deps, config changes
```

### 8.2 Branch Strategy
- `main` — production ready
- `develop` — integration branch
- Feature branches → PR to `develop`
- Releases → `develop` to `main` via PR

### 8.3 Pre-commit Checklist
```bash
make precommit  # runs lint + tests
```
Never commit with failing tests or errors (warnings OK).

---

## 9. Future Development Guidelines

### 9.1 Before Adding a Feature
Answer these questions:
1. Does it serve the survival question?
2. Where does it live in Clean Architecture?
3. Does it need a new domain entity or extend an existing one?
4. What are the edge cases?
5. What tests are needed?

### 9.2 Planned Features (Prioritized)
1. **Onboarding** — 3-screen intro + guided first action (opening balance)
2. **Planned expenses** — future-dated transactions already work; just add PLANNED visual tag
3. **Cloud sync** — Supabase backend, same Flutter codebase
4. **Web support** — replace sqlite3 with drift web backend
5. **Notifications** — subscription renewal alerts, runway warnings

### 9.3 Never Build
- Complex category budgeting (defeats simplicity)
- Social/sharing features (personal survival data)
- Investment portfolio tracking (out of scope)
- Automatic bank sync (privacy, complexity)
